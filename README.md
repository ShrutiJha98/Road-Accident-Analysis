# Road-Accident-Analysis
I recently completed an in-depth project using Power BI and SQL to analyze OLA data across five dynamic dashboards. 🚕 
This project 📈 delves into various operational insights, highlighting key metrics such as vehicle types, cancellation rates, customer ratings, and revenue. By leveraging the strengths of both SQL and Power BI, I developed a data-driven strategy to extract actionable insights.

👉 SQL: Utilized advanced queries to gather relevant data and derive meaningful insights. 
👉 Power BI: Employed for data cleansing, DAX formula application, visualization, and constructing an interactive dashboard.

 📊 Key insights include: 
➡️ Revenue is primarily generated through cash payments (19.3M), followed by UPI (14.2M).
➡️ Customer and driver ratings are fairly consistent across vehicle types, with minor variations ranging between 3.98 and 4.0.
➡️ Ride distances show variability throughout the month, peaking sporadically, reflecting changing customer demand over time.
➡️ The total cancellation rate stands at 28.1%, with drivers responsible for 35% of cancellations and customers for 30%, driven by reasons like vehicle or customer issues and address inaccuracies.
➡️ Prime Sedan, E-Bike, and Prime Plus vehicles contribute significantly to total booking and success values, with the average distance traveled being consistent across categories (~25 km).


This project honed my SQL querying and Power BI skills, enabling me to convert raw data into actionable insights.
